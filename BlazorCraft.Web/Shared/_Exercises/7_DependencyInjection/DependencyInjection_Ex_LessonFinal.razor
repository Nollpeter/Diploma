@* inject EmployeeService, the property should be called EmployeeService *@
@* Register IEmployeeService in EmployeeServiceRegistration.cs ! *@
@* Reuse RenderFragments_LessonFinal and bind its employees so that the values come from EmployeeService *@
@* Be careful! GetEmployees is an async Task, so you cannot bind it directly from the markup! *@
@* Remember the previous lessons, where and how it could be bound! *@
